The main focus of this thesis has been on improving \LLLs support for students
in the universities by providing them with a better learning environment -- an
enhanced \ep~system. For this purpose, the requirements, design, development and
evaluation of the prototype environment has been discussed in detail. This final
chapter summarizes the main contributions of this research to the related
fields, along with the opportunities for the future research projects.

\section{Research Contributions}

The following research contributions to the field and knowledge were made in
course of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Identifying the requirements for the \LLLs in the universities.}
  The first important step of this research was to identify the requirements
  which should be satisfied in order to provide students with comprehensive
  support for their \LLLsn. The literature review showed that there were no
  explicit requirements to follow. Instead, general recommendations were
  identified in various academic publications. 
  
  Six representative existing \ep~systems were reviewed to understand the
  level of development of the \ep~field and what kind of \LLLs support the
  existing systems could provide. Although, the discovered recommendations could
  not have been properly checked against existing \ep~systems due to their
  highly conceptual level, they made a background for further investigations.
  
  \item \textbf{Development of a formal requirements specification.} Following
  the needs of the major stakeholders who were students and lecturers, formal
  requirements for \LLLs support in universities were identified. These
  requirements were mapped to and shown to be congruent with the guidelines and
  recommendations found in the literature. The formal specification that is
  based on the identified requirements can be used or adopted by the developing
  teams of the \ep~systems to improve existing system in the context of
  providing support for \LLLsn.
  
  \item \textbf{Development of the functional prototype.} Based on stakeholders
  feedback, the high priority requirements described in the formal specification
  were implemented in an \ep~system prototype. The Mahara \ep~system was used as
  a base system for the prototype to illustrate that these requirements can be
  successfully implemented in the existing systems and not just a hypothetical
  \ep~system. The functional prototype was implemented to identify the strengths
  and weaknesses of the developed specification. It was also the first attempt
  to address primarily learners' needs rather than focus on institutional
  requirements.
  
  \item \textbf{Development of a multiple perspective evaluation design.}
  Development of a proper evaluation design was a very important task that was
  necessary to complete in order to understand whether the initial research goal
  was achieved. Due to the nature of \LLLsn, evaluating it within the scope of
  this project was challenging on its own. In addition, the \ep~system prototype
  could not have been evaluated in the real world settings. To address this
  issues, a multiple perspective evaluation was designed. It included conducting
  separate evaluation studies using suitable for each study methods to ensure
  that all perspectives were taken into account. Based on the outcomes of the
  evaluation, this approach can be considered successful.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Research and Potential Extensions}
The research presented in this thesis is the first step on the way to providing
students with full support for their \LLLs journey in the universities. In the
course of this research, a number of issues and questions were raised which
creates potential for further investigations. Future research should aim at
exploring and solving these issues to support the findings of the current
research and extend the knowledge added. The following sections suggest
potential future studies.

\subsection{Production of the \ep~system prototype}
Due to the high interest in the outcomes of this project among the research
participants, the next logical step for this research would be moving the
\ep~system prototype to production level. Important part of this step would
include re-assessing outcomes of the evaluations to improve the implementations
based on stakeholders recommendations. A proper user interface would need to be
designed taking into account existing usability issues.

Depending on which \ep~platform is used as a base system, this step would also
require to follow the specific for this platform developers' guidelines. Each
developing community has their established methods and rules which need to be
followed by any contributor. For example, to contribute code developed in this
project to the official Mahara \ep~system release would require such steps as
using Mahara code guidelines in all implementations, adapting the
implementations to the latest system version and submitting contribution to the
Gerrit review system. After code submission, it has to be independently
reviewed by two developers from the core team, fixed according to their feedback
and properly tested. Only after all these steps, the code can be included in the
official system release.

The above example shows a complexity of contributing to the open-source project.
Adding code to the proprietary system is most likely to be even more complicated
process. This potential project should look into these issuses.

\subsection{Further evaluations of the \ep~system prototype}
As it was discussed earlier, evaluation of the prototype implementations in the
real world settings was not feasible due to various reasons. Once the system is
in production version, a complex evaluation should be undertaken to support
current findings. Although difficult and often costly, naturalistic evaluation
or evaluation with real users using real systems to solve real problems is
considered to be crucial \citep{Pries-Heje2008}. In such evaluation a lot of
variable should be taken into account, but at the end it is a real \textit{proof
of the pudding} \citep{Venable2010}.

In addition, to check whether the findings can be generalized, evaluations of
the \ep~system with a larger number of participants and using different sampling
techniques where randomization of the sample is possible would be required. This
research used largely qualitative methods which are knows for their poor
generalizability \citep{Trochim2001}. Therefore, one of the potential future
research projects would look into the question of testing the finding from this
perspective.

\subsection[Optimal interface design]{Optimal interface for the implementations
supporting \LLLs requirements} 

As this project was focusing on the development of a functional prototype for
theory testing, user interface development was left outside of the research
scope. However, interface design plays an important role in acceptance of any
system by users as well as it might influence users' productivity and users'
satisfaction from using this system. Potential research project in the area of
HCI would look into the problem of designing an optimal user interface for the
features implemented in \ep~system supporting \LLLsn. 

The question of developing an optimal user interface is less likely to lose its
interest over time. The field of designing good and efficient Web interfaces
will always be a \textit{hot topic} due to the rapidly changing technologies
aimed on improving user experience. From this perspective, it would be
interesting to analyse whether the current interface implementations could have
been done using other visual representations and how it would influence
learners' perception of the system.

\subsection{``Seamless'' virtual learning environment for \LLLs support} 
For any learning environment to provide comprehensive support for \LLLs, it
should take into account all the transitions that individuals make during their
lifespan. Investigate how these transitions happen and how they are supported on
a system level would be another potential research area. This could bring up the
questions of improving interoperability standards, extending the range of
environments that support data transfer between them, developing standards for
trustworthy grades, certifications and qualifications export, and many others.

From another angle, it is possible that most of learning transitions would
involve changes of learning environments, both physical and virtual. Does not
matter whether these transitions are from school to university from college to
workplace, or between workplace, it is less likely that systems used by learners
in high school would look the same as systems used in universities. As a result,
with every transition people need to learn how to master new virtual learning
environment, get used to user interface and make use of the new environment most
efficient for productive learning. Can this process be improved or simplified?
If yes, how it can be done to improve learning experience?

\section{General Conclusions}

This thesis has presented a research project aimed on the development of an
\ep~aided learner-centered learning environment capable of providing
comprehensive support for students' \LLLs in universities. Based on the work
presented in this thesis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is possible to develop such a learner-centered virtual learning
  environment that can provide support for \LLLs in universities, as has been
  demonstrated by the implementation of the stakeholders requirements in an
  \ep~system prototype.
  \item As has been shown by extending the Mahara \ep~system, it is feasible to
  improve an existing \ep~system based on the formal requirements specification
  developed in course of this project, and therefore to address the
  expectations of the \ep~systems to support \LLLsn.
  \item The findings from the evaluation studies indicate that the prototype
  functionality meets the needs of the stakeholders in both learning and
  teaching contexts. However, these findings should be confirmed by the further
  research investigations suggested in the previous section.
\end{enumerate}

Overall, this research showed how much can be achieved by encouraging
cooperation between the stakeholders and listening to the learner's voice. With
the rapidly changing world of technology, it is very important. Understanding
the learners' needs will help universities to invest in the successful adoption
of the suitable learning systems providing students with technology that would
assist their lifelong learning journey anywhere and at any time.
