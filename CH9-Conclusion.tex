The main focus of this thesis has been on improving \LLLs support for students
in the universities by providing them with a better learning environment -- an
enhanced \ep~system. For this purpose, the requirements, design, development and
evaluation of the prototype environment has been discussed in detail. This final
chapter summarizes the main contributions of this research to the related
fields, along with the opportunities for the future research projects.

\section{Research Contributions}

The following research contributions to the field were made in course of this
project:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identifing the requirements for the \LLLs in the universities
  \item Development of formal requirements specification
  \item Development of the functional prototype
  \item Development of a multi-perspective evaluation design
\end{enumerate}



\section{Future Research}
%What new questions can be developed for deeper research?
The research presented in this thesis is the first step on the way to providing
students with full support for their \LLLs journey in the universities. In the
course of this research, a number of issues and questions were raised which
creates potential for further investigations. Future research should aim at
exploring and solving these issues to support the findings of the current
research and extend the knowledge added. The following sections suggest
potential future studies.

\subsection{Production level of the \ep~system prototype}
The next logical step  would be moving the \ep~system prototype into production

\subsection{Further evaluation of the existing \ep~systems}
Further evaluation of suitability of the existing \ep~systems to
support \LLLsn.

\subsection{Seamless environment for \LLLs} 
Seamless environment for \LLLs -- systems transitions from early childhood to
late adulthood.
