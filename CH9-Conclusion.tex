The main focus of this thesis has been on improving \LLLs support for students
in the universities by providing them with a better learning environment -- an
enhanced \ep~system. For this purpose, the requirements, design, development and
evaluation of the prototype environment has been discussed in detail. This final
chapter summarizes the main contributions of this research to the related
fields, along with the opportunities for the future research projects.

\section{Research Contributions}

The following research contributions to the field and knowledge were made in
course of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Identifying the requirements for the \LLLs in the universities.}
  The first important step of this research was to identify the requirements
  which should be satisfied in order to provide students with comprehensive
  support for their \LLLsn. The literature review showed that there were no
  explicit requirements to follow. Instead, general recommendations were
  identified in various academic publications. 
  
  Six representative existing \ep~systems were reviewed to understand the
  level of development \ep~field and what kind of \LLLs support the existing
  systems could provide. Although, the discovered recommendations could not
  have been properly checked against existing \ep~systems due to their highly
  conceptual level, they made a background for further investigations.
  
  \item \textbf{Development of formal requirements specification.} Following the
  needs of the major stakeholders who were students and lecturers, formal
  requirements were identified. These requirements were congruent with the
  guidelines found in the literature. This formal specification can be used or
  adopted by the developing team of the \ep~systems to improve existing system
  in the context of providing support for \LLLsn.
  
  \item \textbf{Development of the functional prototype.}
  
  \item \textbf{Development of a multiple perspective evaluation design.}
  Development of a proper evaluation design was a very important task that was
  necessary to understand whether the initial research goal was achieved.  
  Due to the nature of \LLLsn, evaluating it within the scope of this project
  was challenging on its own. In addition, the \ep~system prototype could not
  have been evaluated in the real world settings. To address this issues, a
  multiple perspective evaluation was designed. It included conducting separate
  evaluation studies using suitable for each study methods to ensure that all
  perspectives were taken into account. Based on the outcomes of the evaluation,
  this approach can be considered successful.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Research and Potential Extensions}
%What new questions can be developed for deeper research?
The research presented in this thesis is the first step on the way to providing
students with full support for their \LLLs journey in the universities. In the
course of this research, a number of issues and questions were raised which
creates potential for further investigations. Future research should aim at
exploring and solving these issues to support the findings of the current
research and extend the knowledge added. The following sections suggest
potential future studies.

\subsection{Production of the \ep~system prototype}
The next logical step for this research would be moving the \ep~system prototype
to production level. Important part of this step would include reassessing
outcomes of the evaluations to improve the implementations based on stakeholders
recommendations. A proper user interface would need to be designed taking into
account existing usability issues. 

Depending on which \ep~platform is used as a base system, this step would also
require to follow its specific developers guidelines. For example, to contribute
code developed in this project to official Mahara \ep~system release would
require such steps as using Mahara code guidelines in any implementations and
submitting contribution to Gerrit review system, then the code has to be
independently reviewed by two developers from the core team and properly tested.
Only after all these steps, the code can be included in the official system
release. Each developing community has their established methods and rules which
need to be followed by any contributor.

\subsection[Optimal interface design]{Optimal interface for the implementations
supporting \LLLs requirements} 

As this project was focusing on the development of a functional prototype for
theory testing, user interface development was left outside of the research
scope. However, interface design plays an important role in acceptance of any
system by users as well as it might influence users' productivity and users'
satisfaction from using this system. Potential research project in the area of
HCI would look into the problem of designing an optimal user interface for the
features implemented in \ep~system supporting \LLLsn.

\subsection{Further evaluations of the \ep~system prototype}
As it was discussed earlier, evaluation of the prototype implementations in the
real world settings was not feasible due to various reasons. Once the system is
in production version, a complex evaluation should be undertaken to support
current findings. Although difficult and often costly, naturalistic evaluation
or evaluation with real users using real systems to solve real problems is
considered to be crucial \citep{Pries-Heje2008}. In such evaluation a lot of
variable should be taken into account, but at the end it is a real \textit{proof
of the pudding} \citep{Venable2010}.

In addition, to check whether the findings can be generalized, evaluations of
the \ep~system with a larger number of participants and using different sampling
techniques where randomization of the sample is possible would be required. This
research used largerly qualitative methods which are knows for their poor
generalizability \citep{Trochim2001}. Therefore, one of the potential
future research projects would look into the question of testing the finding
from this perspective.

\subsection{Seamless environment for \LLLs support} 
For any learning environment to provide comprehensive support for \LLLs, it
should take into account all the transitions that individuals make during their
lifespan. Investigate how these transitions happen and how they are supported on
a system level would be another potential research area. This could bring up the
questions of improving interoperability standards, extending the range of
environments that support data transfer between them, developing standards for
trustworthy grades, certifications and qualifications export, and many others.

From another angle, it is possible that most of learning transitions would
involve changes of learning environments, both physical and virtual. Does not
matter whether these transitions are from school to university from college to
workplace, or between workplace, it is less likely that systems used by learners
in high school would look the same as systems used in universities. As a result,
with every transition people need to learn how to master new virtual learning
environment, get used to user interface and make use of the new environment most
efficient for productive learning. Can this process be improved or simplified?
If yes, how it can be done to improve learning experience?
