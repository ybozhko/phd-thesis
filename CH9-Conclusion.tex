learn.}{\textit{Peter F. Drucker}}

The main focus of this thesis has been on improving \LLLs support for students
in the universities by providing them with better learning environment -- an
enhanced \ep~system. For this purpose, the requirements, design, development and
evaluation of the prototype environment has been discussed in detail. This final
chapter summarizes the main contributions of this research to the related
fields, along with the opportunities for the future research projects.
