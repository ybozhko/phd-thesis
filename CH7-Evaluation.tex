\section{Study Two. Group Experiment - \LLLc Skills Development and
Demostration}

\subsection{Goals}

To find out if undergrad students find concept mapping embedded into eP helpful
in terms of sddressing GA and tracking their progress in learning.

\subsection{Research Protocol}

Appendix.

\subsection{Participants Profile}

Undergarduate or young students. 
3 groups with differeces in profiles:

- new about GA used eP for that
- new about GA, did not use eP for that
- did not know about GA and eP

\subsection{Activities and Artefacts}

Tasks + questionnaire

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}

The data collected during this evaluation were based on questionnaire results,
observations and system records.

Questionnaire results. Include some graph + user comments.

\subsection{Conclusions}
 
\section{Study Three. System Validation by Experienced Students}
\subsection{Goals}
\subsection{Research Protocol}
\subsection{Participants Profile}

Maximum variation cases \citep{Flyvbjerg2006}: cases were different in
one dimension: experience with using eP system.

\subsection{Activities and Artefacts}



\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}

Face-to-face interview, system logs, cmaps, artefacts uploaded to the system.
