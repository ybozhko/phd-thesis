\chapter{Literature Review -- Lifelong Learning \label{cha:litrev}}
%3400
In order to answer the first research question \textit{``What is the concept of
\LLLs and its connection to the universities?''}, it is important to establish a
full understanding of the main concepts used in this thesis. Doing so requires 
reference to areas outside of ICT field as underlying concepts can be found
primarily in the domain of Education.

This chapter introduces the key concept of \LLLs that will be in focus
throughout the thesis. First, the origins of the term of \textit{\LLLsn} and
related concepts are discussed in Section \ref{sec:concepts}. The crucial
differences between these concepts and how they transformed over time, driven by
changing society and economics, are explored. Second, through the increasing
focus on \LLLs skills in the world of work and in higher education, Section
\ref{sec:uni} shows the need for \LLLs support in universities. Universities are
in the centre of this discussion as they provide the necessary organizational
framework, theoretical principles and practical experience for \LLLs
\citep{Knapper2000}, which can be seen in the role and influence of the
universities in the educational systems of most countries as the \textit{keepers
of the intellectual traditions of a nation} \citep[p.~96]{Longworth2003}. Third,
in Section \ref{sec:needs} the general needs for successful \LLLs are outlined.
While no explicit requirements have been found in the literature, commonly
accepted recommendations and guidelines were discovered in various sources that
will be used as a background for further exploration in Chapter \ref{cha:model}.

\section{Literature Review Process}
The literature review on \LLLs (Chapter \ref{cha:litrev}) and a review of
institutional and open learning spaces (Chapter \ref{cha:systudy}) that provide
and support background for this thesis were conducted by systematically locating
and reviewing books, journals and conference proceedings in the area. The main
methods to identify relevant literature were recommendations of domain experts
and a library search. Relevant articles were identified by reading titles and
abstracts of selected journal articles and papers in conference proceedings.
Where possible the latest ten years of issues of the following journals were
looked through: ``British Journal of Educational Technology'', ``International
Journal of Lifelong Education'', ``European Journal of Education'', ``\LLLc in
Europe'', ``International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning'', ``New
Zealand Journal of Adult Learning'', ``Journal of Computer Assisted Learning'',
``European Journal of Engineering Education'', and ``International Journal of
ePortfolio''. These jornals were selected to review the area in cross-sections,
such as New Zealand -- Europe and education -- technology.

In addition, a keyword search was carried out on the Internet and academic
resources (such as Education Research
Complete\footnote{\url{http://www.ebscohost.com/academic/education-research-complete}},
Academic Search
Premier\footnote{\url{http://www.ebscohost.com/academic/academic-search-premier}},
Directory of Open Access Journals\footnote{\url{http://www.doaj.org}}, Journal
Storage -- JSTOR\footnote{\url{http://www.jstor.org}}, Google
Scholar\footnote{\url{http://scholar.google.com}}) to cover conference publications not available in the library or through electronic library
databases. The following keywords and combinations of keywords were used in the
search: \textit{\LLLsn}, \textit{life-long learning}, \textit{e-learning},
\textit{ePortfolio}, \textit{e-portfolio}, \textit{electronic portfolio},
\textit{Web 2.0}, \textit{learning environment}, and \textit{learning technology}.

This review helped to discover previous work in the area (described in Section
\ref{sec:related}), explore methods that could be applied to this research,
increase the depth and breadth of knowledge of the field, and identify domain
experts and other people working in the same field who could be valuable to
contact. Besides finding relevant information in the literature, it was also
important to identify the gaps that currently exist (more detailed discussion
can be found in Chapter \ref{cha:systudy}). It will be shown further that these
gaps are based on a lack of connection between the areas of \LLLs theories and
learning technology. While a lot of effort is put into developing theories and
producing systems that support education and learning, the literature review
shows that little substantial work exists on combining these two areas.

As a continuous process, the literature review for this research was updated by
actively acquiring and reading the relevant articles emerging in the literature
throughout the duration of the thesis. To structure and facilitate the
literature review process, these articles were organized into a literature
database and managed by the Mendeley\footnote{\url{http://www.mendeley.com}}
reference manager.

\section{The General Concept of \LLLc}
\label{sec:concepts}
\subsection{Terms and Definitions}

The European Commission \citeyearpar{EuropeanCommission2000} defined \LLLs as:

\longquote{All learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of
improving knowledge, skills and competencies within a personal, civic, social
and/or employment-related perspective.} 

However, the concept is not as simple as it looks: \LLLs consists of a variety
of meanings, models and ideas. Such terms as \textit{\LLLsn}, \textit{life-wide
learning}, \textit{lifelong education}, \textit{adult education},
\textit{recurrent education}, \textit{continuing education}, and \textit{further
education} create a set of related, yet different concepts \citep{Hager2011}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{CH3-F1-Learning}
\caption[Changing concepts of learning]{Changing concepts of learning 
\citep{Jarvis2004}}
\label{fig:learning}
\end{figure}

\textit{Continuing education} (also referred to as \textit{adult education}) was
introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There was no common definition of
this term, but in some sources  \citep{Jarvis2004} it was described as all
learning activities which could be undertaken after compulsory schooling is
finished. Figure \ref{fig:learning} compares the main concepts in education
according to the time spent by individuals learning/studying across their
lifespan. As can be seen, continuing education was usually part-time and
occurred less frequently than other forms of education.

\FloatBarrier
The term \textit{recurrent education} was widely used by OECD until the 1980s
\citep{Jarvis2004}. Unlike intermittent continuing education, the idea of
reccurent education was to allow adults to spend full time studying in
formal education sector doing on-the-job trainings or post-compulsory education
of any kind. Arguably, this main feature of the right for full time study made
the concept of recurrent education disappear from the education discourse: it
was too expensive and difficult to support this policy.

Evolution of the concepts of recurrent and continuing education played an
important role in development of new educational models. While these two terms
had different underlying philosophies, they both recognized the fact that
acquisition of knowledge should be a lifelong process, from \textit{cradle to
grave} \citep{Hargreaves2004}.

The initial term of \textit{\LLLsn} originates back in the early 20th century
and is contributed to John Dewey \citeyearpar{Dewey2004}. From his
perspective, \LLLs had to be centered on the individual's ability to take an
active role in democratic society. He saw education as a learning process which
was influenced by the growth of the individual and society, both interlinked.
Dewey's key to \LLLs was in developing active learning, enabling the individual
to reflect and change throughout life, emphasizing that non-formal education was
as important as formal education.

The concept of \textit{lifelong education} first came to real prominence in 1972
after Edgar Faure's Report ``Learning to Be'' for UNESCO. The concept described
in this report was announced to be the leading one for the reform in education.
Faure's Report used four principles for the lifelong education architecture
\citep{Faure1972}: vertical integration (education should occur throughout one's
life); horizontal integration (acceptance of non-formal and formal education);
the democratization of education (more widespread involvement of learners); and
learning society (restructuring of educational system). However, according to
Hager's \citeyearpar{Hager2011} analysis, UNESCO's concept of \textit{lifelong
education} is overly narrow as it puts the emphasis on formal education as the
only sufficient and relevant form of learning to provide actual
\textit{education}.

\subsection{Paradigm Shift and \LLLc Today}

Almost 40 years after the original idea of lifelong education was introduced, 
it re-emerged in the policy discourse under the term \LLLs \citep{Boshier2000}.
This shift was not only semantic, but also substantive, which showed that \LLLs
and lifelong education are not the same: lifelong education aimed to develop
more humane individuals and communities, while \LLLsn's goal was in retaining
and gaining new skills that would help individuals adapt to rapid changes in
their workplace \citep{Medel-Anonuevo2001}. Lifelong learning is based on the
notion of the individual learner as a consumer. And as a result, if consumers
decide not to take advantage of all the opportunities they have, then they are
responsible for this decision. Therefore, being constructed as individual
activity, learning depends entirely on personal motivation.

Unlike learning, education is a provided service \citep{Boshier2000} that
requires someone to be responsible for providing resources, developing policies,
etc. The emphasis on \textit{learning} rather than \textit{education} is
significant \citep{Tuijnman2002}, as it moves focus from the institutions onto
the individual. Although, it does not mean that institutions and governments
play no role whatsoever. Their role is rather transformed into investment in
individuals and creating conditions for them to take charge of their learning
for both personal and public benefits \citep{Chen2009}.

However, a perspective drawn by \citet{Duke2001} offers another, less optimistic
interpretation of this change. Shift of focus from education itself to the
learner brings up important and unresolved problems. If it is accepted that
learning is \textit{``essentially an individual and private matter''}
\citep[p.~508]{Duke2001}, then providing resources and public funding for
education as well as the problem of inequitable access of individuals to this
education become less important. Taking into account that not everyone has the
same opportunities to participate in \LLLs due to structural barriers depending
on cultural capital, this shift appears to be a serious issue.

Following Duke's ideas, \citet{Aspin2001} note that \LLLs is not only about
needs of individuals. There is an element of public good embedded in the concept
of promoting citizens who are lifelong learners and in this sense society at
large benefits as well as the individual. To guarantee the welfare of everyone,
society has an interest in providing opportunities and securing conditions for
all of its members where they can perform their duties as citizens in a
\textit{participative democracy} \citep{Aspin2001}.

Nevertheless, over the last decade, \LLLs support has become a part of official
government policy in a number of countries around the world. As an example,
European Commission established a budget of nearly 7 billion Euro for the period
of 2007-2013 for \textit{Lifelong learning programme} which aims to support
education and training at school, college, university, in the workplace and in the
community across Europe \citep{TheEducation2009}. In New Zealand a number of
governmental documents \citep{NewZealandMinistryofEducation2008} now mention the
\textit{``success of all New Zealanders through lifelong learning"}. As a
result, the national tertiary education system of the country has been
restructured to support seamless connections and \LLLs ideas, although there is
no explicit policy in this area \citep{Benseman2006}.

In contrast, in 2006, the Canadian Council on Learning developed the 17
indicators and 26 specific measures (Figure \ref{fig:cli2010}) called Composite
Learning Index (CLI) that are used to calculate annual progress in \LLLs in the
country \citep{CanadianCouncilonLearning2011}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption[The 2010 Composite Learning Index of Canada]{The 2010 Composite
Learning Index of Canada \citep{CanadianCouncilonLearning2011}}
\label{fig:cli2010}
\end{figure}

By using CLI, Canadian government expects to draw attention to the benefits of
\LLLs and demonstrate learning opportunities that occur outside of classroom
settings. In August 2010, the European Union adopted this Index as European
\LLLc Indicators (ELLI). Similar to CLI, ELLI were using UNESCO approach of four
pillars of learning: Learning to Know, Learning to Do, Learning to Be, and
Learning to Live Together \citep{ELLIDevelopmentTeam2010}.

\subsection{Components and Attributes of Lifelong Learning}
As shown on Figure \ref{fig:lllfmwrk}, in terms of purposeful learning
activities \LLLs is usually split into the following components
\citep{Longworth2003, Tuijnman2002}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Formal learning -- institutionally graded, and hierarchically structured
system, often leads to qualification;
  \item Non-formal learning -- organized systematic educational activity
  external to formal education;
  \item Informal learning -- planned or not planned, but conscious learning from
the experience;
  \item Incidental learning -- not intentional, an accompaniment to everyday
  life, learning during the action.
\end{itemize} 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{CH3-F3-LLLFramework}
\caption[Framework for \LLLc]{Framework for \LLLc (based on
\citealp[p.~11]{Divjak2004})}
\label{fig:lllfmwrk}
\end{figure}

Some researchers \citep{Longworth2003} recognize only two categories of lifelong
learning, formal and non-formal, leaving informal and incidental parts of it as
the elements of non-formal learning. Boshier \citeyearpar{Boshier2000} states
that the current reality is such that the formal and non-formal categories of
\LLLs are like \textit{``two parallel railway lines. Both cross the landscape but
never touch''} (p. 11), explaining that formal learning have practically nothing
to do with non-formal.

From another perspective, \LLLs encompasses the elements of self-direction,
long-term and life-wide learning \citep{Schuetze2006}. Rubenson
\citeyearpar{Rubenson2002} called these \textit{three fundamental attributes of
\LLLs}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lifelong -- means everything from cradle to grave;
  \item Life-wide -- takes place outside the formal education system;
  \item Self-directed -- is guided by the learners themselves and does not
  limit itself to education.
\end{itemize} 

Other essential characteristics of \LLLs identified by Weert and Kendall
\citeyearpar{Kendall2004} include, but are not limited to the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most of \LLLs occurs outside of the classroom and is not triggered by
  textbooks;
  \item The driving force in \LLLs is self-motivation and active participation
  of learners;
  \item Lifelong learning involves interactions, groups, community learning and
  other social activities;
  \item Solving artificial tasks does not matter in \LLLsn. Achievements in
  real-life situations, measured by common standards, are important;
  \item Lifelong learning is learner-centred and aims for personal
  achievements;
  \item Lifelong learners should maintain an achievements portfolio, hence the
  concept of a portfolio has always been central to supporting \LLLsn.
\end{itemize} 

These characteristics describe \LLLs as flexible, social and personal at the
same time. According to Weert and Kendall \citeyearpar{Kendall2004}, \LLLs can
also be called a demand-driven as the current economics develops the need for
\textit{education on demand} where learners decide the content of their
education striving to get marketable and better developed skills.

Over recent years the skills that are central to supporting \LLLs ability have
been identified and expanded in more detail. Although not exclusive, they
include: solving problems, critical thinking, utilizing technology, and
information literacy; working with others in teams, communication skills,
leadership and social interaction skills; self-management; collecting, analyzing
and organizing information; planning and organizing activities; cultural
awareness and understanding \citep{Brooks2008,Heinrich2007,Otala1997,Pitman2009}. 

Figure \ref{fig:llldim} summarizes all concepts mentioned in this section.
The version of \LLLs used throughout this thesis will be referred to as the one
that is based on formal, non-formal, informal and incidental learning with
long-term, life-wide and self-directed attributes. This \LLLs is demand-driven,
flexible and supports personal as well as social learning activities.

Hereinafter, any further reference to \LLLs will be made in terms of these
concepts.

\section[\LLLc in Universities]{\LLLc in Universities\footnote{This section was
adopted from the section originally published as part of Chapter 8 ``The Role of
Institutions in Creating Student-Focused Virtual Learning Spaces with ePortfolio
Systems'' of the book ``Physical and Virtual Learning Spaces in Higher
Education: Concepts for the Modern Learning Environment". Full reference can be
found in \hyperref[sec:pub]{Publications and Presentations} section.} }

\label{sec:uni}

This section now turns attention to the concept of \LLLs as it relates to
universities. Lifelong learning including such attributes as \textit{life-long},
\textit{self-directed} and \textit{life-wide} learning has following significant
implications. As already mentioned above, \textit{life-long} means the full life
span of an individual. From the institutional view, it starts when students are
enrolled in the university and finishes when they graduate.
\textit{Self-directed} learning in academic environment is based on being an
active, highly-motivated student acquiring and enhancing new skills and
knowledge. The \textit{life-wide} component of learning implies that learning
can and should not occur only through formal university study, as personal and
professional development takes place in many contexts. 

Attwell \citeyearpar{Attwell2007} considers the fact that everyday non-formal
types of learning are not connected to institutional formal education to be the
major issue of modern learning, which can make students see their study at
university as \textit{something irrelevant to their identities} (p. 4). For
successful \LLLsn, progress of the achievements should be recorded and
maintained over a long period and across various sources, formal as well as
non-formal \citep{Kay2008}.

%This criticism has become even more prominent with the growth of information
% now available through the Internet.

The importance of \LLLs skills in addition to academic and subject knowledge has
been increasingly emphasized in the workplace and public policy
\citep{Morgan-Klein2007,Sutherland2006}. Recent research
\citep{Simmons-McDonald2009} shows that \LLLs becomes an important factor that
influences the employability. Individuals today need to continue to update and
upgrade their skills and knowledge even after completing formal education in
order to survive and thrive in today's changing world. Otala
\citeyearpar{Otala1997} states that required flexibility and adaptability to
these rapid changes are gained through \textit{better developed learning skills
and the right attitudes that help individuals quickly and easily learn new
things} (p. 456). Therefore, current students need to \textit{possess something
more than skills which grow obsolete as technology advances}
\cite[p.~195]{Field2003}.

Higher education institutions have responded to the need for \LLLs skills by
defining their own strategies to promote \LLLsn. Many institutions in Europe,
the United States, Australia and New Zealand now explicitly express the \LLLs
characteristics they strive for in their graduates \citep{Scanlon2006}.
Australian universities, such as Curtin University, have made policy
declarations committing to graduate attributes across their programmes
\citep{CurtinUniversity2006}. Graduate attributes generally represent the core
learning outcomes, skills and qualities that students should develop during
their university education \citep{Hughes2010}.

The College of Sciences of Massey University has formulated a draft \LLLs policy
\citep{MasseyUniversity2008} that expresses values, support and expectations in
regards to \LLLsn. Graduate profiles, naming \LLLs skills such as critical
thinking, effective communication, teamwork and leadership have been established
for many degree programmes \citep{Davies2003,McAlister2003}. The accreditation
criteria for engineering degrees now refer to and demand soft skills that are
the skills essential for \LLLs \citep{Aller2005,Guest2006,Muffo2001}. The need
for a holistic education and the development of students beyond technical
competency is requested
\citep{Brakke2002,Davies2003,Dowling2006,Fallows2003,Grabowski2004,Hernon2006}.

In order to enact policy, academics need to incorporate development
opportunities for these skills into their teaching and learning designs.
Arguably, while individual academics succeed in doing so by using techniques
such as group work, reflective journals and authentic assessment
\citep{Clarke2003,Lombardi2008}, universities are far from achieving the
required levels of \LLLs skills in their graduates.

A possible explanation of this problem might be that while graduate profiles
express graduate attributes and \LLLs skills, the individual courses making up
the degrees have not been adjusted accordingly to promote constructive alignment
\citep{Hughes2010,Biggs2007}. One consequence of the lack of alignment between
courses and graduate profiles is that students are not presented with a coherent
picture across their courses and that it is difficult to see the connections
between single courses. 

Some academics may lack awareness, knowledge and support to fully incorporate
the development of \LLLs skills into their teaching. Arguably, academics who do
not consciously practice their own \LLLs skills development will find it
difficult to lead and to inspire their students \citep{Linden2003}. Yet,
students need guidance in developing \LLLs skills \citep{Leone2019}, both to
recognise their importance and to acquire knowledge on \textit{how to} study
\citep{Medel-Anonuevo2001}. The key point is that the currently dominant
academic systems are in conflict with the characteristics of \LLLs skills.
Instead of supporting the needs of learning to be self-directed, life-wide and
lifelong, many of these systems are overly assessment-driven and focus on course
content and duration.

\section{Requirements for Successful \LLLc}
\label{sec:needs}
Based on considerations outlined earlier in this chapter, this section brings
together the requirements for provision of successful \LLLs support for
students within university settings. While no explicit set of requirements has
been found, the literature identifies a number of guidelines that have to be
satisfied in order to achieve successful \LLLs support in universities. These
guidelines and recommendations can be summarized as following:
 
\begin{description}
  \item[G1] Universities should provide support for all aspects of \LLLs
  (formal, informal, non-formal, incidental) \citep{Attwell2007, Smidt2011};
  \item[G2] Students need guidance on various levels of academic development and
  learning \citep{Leone2019};
  \item[G3] Lecturers should be an active facilitators and promote involving
  learning experiences \citep{Leone2019}; 
  \item[G4] Learning materials should be organized in the way that would help
students learn how they learn \citep{Medel-Anonuevo2001};
  \item[G5] Communication and collaboration are essential parts of learning
  process \citep{Schaffert2008};
  \item[G6] Learning progress should be recorded from various sources and
  maintained over a long period of time \citep{Kay2008};
  \item[G7] Students need to be aware of their personal achievements
\citep{Schuetze2006};
  \item[G8] Students should develop understanding and confidence in their
  knowledge and be able to address higher-order skills (graduate attributes in university
  context) \citep{Hart1999};
  \item[G9] Students should be able to evaluate and reflect on their own
  performance and learning progress \citep{Mourtos2003}.
\end{description} 

These theoretical recommendations will be used to guide further exploration of
 how \LLLs can be supported using technical solutions available in universities.

\section{Summary} 

Following from the discussions in this chapter, it is important to emphasize
the following key points: \LLLs plays an important role in current global
economics and societies
\citep{Jarvis2008,Simmons-McDonald2009,InternationalLabourOffice2008}; \LLLs
skills have become a fundamental part of personal development; governments and
educational institutions, universities in particular, are attempting to promote
and support \LLLsn; at this stage, \LLLs support currently provided in many
universities is not sufficient to satisfy the needs of students as lifelong
learners.

In order to support this argument, the next chapter will review the world of
virtual learning spaces that are currently used in universities and outside of
educational sector to support various learning activities. Characteristics as
well as strength and weaknesses of the existing systems in supporting \LLLs
in universities will be discussed. The connection and gap that exists between
these systems from the \LLLs perspective will be thoroughly explored.
