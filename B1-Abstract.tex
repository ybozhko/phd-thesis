The concept of \LLLs is based on the principle of the self-directed pursuit of
knowledge or skills that occur throughout one's life. While the concept is not
new, the importance of \LLLs skills in addition to academic and subject
knowledge has been increasingly emphasised in the workplace and public policy
over the last decade. Higher education institutions, and universities in
particular, recognise the importance of \LLLs and define their own strategies to
promote it such as including learning attributes in their graduate profiles.
Yet, at this stage, \LLLs support provided in universities is not strong enough
to meet the needs of learners.

This research project explores theoretical concepts, available technical
solutions and \LLLs support needs of universities. As it is shown in the
literature review, theories in this area have already been developed followed by
raising awareness and attempts at universities to support \LLLsn. Currently,
basic level technical solutions are available, such as \ep~systems or
accommodation of Web 2.0 tools into university settings, but their shortcomings
are hindering full adoption.

In the course of this thesis, this research analyses and suggests opportunities
and conditions for incorporating an \ep~system into the institutional support
for learning in order to design a learner-centered e-learning environment which
will provide comprehensive support for \LLLs in universities.
