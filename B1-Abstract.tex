The abstract should be no more than 350 words long. It should present an
overview of your thesis in accessible language.

Remember that the purpose of an abstract is to help the potential reader decide
whether or not they want toread your thesis. You should therefore mention the
important features: motivation, statement of the problem, your approach, the
quality of your results, and what conclusions you drew.
